                     <p>Every new trader in every asset class enters the market with one main goal: buy low and sell high in order to make a profit. This sounds simple enough, and is basically what we are trying to do, but the idiosyncracies of the market make it much more difficult than it seems at first glance. This is the main reason why many successful traders base their strategies on historical time and price data, otherwise know as charts. These charts allow us to perform what is called “technical analysis” on financial markets, a method that attempts to separate fundamental noise from true supply and demand action.</p>

                     <p>Over years of trial and error in markets, traders realized that a detailed “trading plan” to guide investment strategy is the best way to minimize emotional involvement, as well as give a solid foundation for comparative analysis and optimization. Essentially what this entails is laying out a set of guidelines that can be broadly applied to the markets you are trading, but that contain very specific rules for entering, exiting, and managing trades.</p>

                     <p>Below we have created a sample trading plan that can be used as a template for navigating the choppy altcoin waters. This should not be viewed as a comprehensive roadmap to profit, but rather as a starting point and initial criterion for traders that want to develop their strategy within this framework.</p>

                    <p>While there will be many similarities between legacy market trading plans and crypto market trading plans, especially in structure, there are some key differences that we want to outline before diving into the nitty gritty. First of all, crypto markets are young and highly illiquid markets which implies that volatility is orders of magnitude greater than in those traditional markets (such as stocks, bonds, and indices).</p>

                    <p>Additionally, these markets can be subject to manipulation by large position holders (aka whales), so having a firm grasp on the technical picture is often more valuable than knowing the details of the fundamentals. And lastly, due to the experimental nature of these projects we think it is paramount to speculate only with funds that can be lost in their entirety. This is just proper risk management.</p>

                    <p>Other than these few key factors, trading the cryptocurrency markets is just as legitimate as trading the legacy markets, but with much greater profit potential for prudent and selective participants.</p>

                   <p>As we previously mentioned, the main goal in these market will be to buy low and sell high so that is what we are basing our trading strategy on. Not only that, but we are looking for assets that have been under­owned and underappreciated by traders in the recent past, as well as those that exhibit signs of a newly emerging bull market.</p>

                   <p>The rules listed below will assist in finding and executing trades in these markets, however there is no substitute for hard work and research. There are potentially hundreds of coins to choose from so combing through them one by one and identifying those that fit our criteria is a large part of our potential success in these markets.</p>

                   <p>Once we have identified the assets we are interested in, then we can start strictly applying our trading criteria in order to glean optimal entry and exit areas for each setup. Despite the fact that this may all sound easy enough, in real trading conditions things get much more complicated. Remember, this will take alot of practice, but the rewards last a lifetime!</p>
